Thers's a procedure to insert some test data : xp_inserTestData.

I haven't completed the part to read report.json from file.


List bellow had been completed but may change in the future :
1. script to ask data
2. db design to view data

List bellow need to work : 
1. get user's isAlive data
2. read report.json into sql server.
